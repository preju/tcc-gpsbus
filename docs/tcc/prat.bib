abstract = {In this paper, we present two deterministic selection algorithms with application to sorting for the CGM and BSP models. The first is a parallel algorithm whose computation time is cost optimal, which runs with O(n/p)computation time and O(min(log p, log log n))communication rounds for n/p≥p\^{}$\epsilon$ and $\epsilon$>0. The second is a parallel algorithm whose number of communication rounds is optimal, which runs with O(n/p log p)computation time and a constant number of communication rounds for n/p≥p\^{}$\epsilon$ and $\epsilon$>0. In addition, we apply the second selection algorithm to sorting. The sorting algorithm runs with O(n/p log n)computation time and a constant number of communication rounds, when n/p≥p\^{}$\epsilon$ and $\epsilon$≥2.},
